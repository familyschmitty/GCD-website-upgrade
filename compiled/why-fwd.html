The Progress ABL market has a single supplier. The technology is closed source, proprietary. So,
there is nowhere else to go for licensing, support, maintenance, and new features. This creates
very little competitive pressure on pricing and little incentive for innovation. This is not a

The #1 complaint we hear from Progress customers is the high cost of the platform.
</p>
<p>Since there is only one vendor, there is very little competitive pressure controlling prices
in this market. As a result, you do all the work in developing your application, but you still
pay a sizable amount of fees above and beyond that to deploy it, and to support and maintain the
platform beneath it. As your user base and choice of deployment platforms increases, so do your
costs.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the pool of available Progress developers is relatively small, so their costs are
typically higher than those on other platforms, such as Java.
</p>
<p>
Finally, some application partners have noted that there is an opportunity cost associated with a
Progress application, in that market awareness and acceptance tends to be significantly lower than
for that of an open and modern platform like Java.

<p>
A language's design defines what an application can do easily and consequently, the application's
constraints. As a language originally conceived to be English-like and intuitive, the ABL now
suffers from this original design principle and other limitations built into the core platform.
</p>
<p>
The ABL is a very syntax-heavy language; most new features are supported directly by adding syntax.
This syntax has grown over the years to include thousands of keywords in myriad, often inconsistent
combinations. This compares to only dozens of keywords and a relatively simple syntax in Java. Since
most new Progress development features must be provided in the form of language changes, and there
is only one vendor that can modify the core platform, it is difficult for third parties to add value
to the platform in a first class manner. The technology ecosystem is thus inherently limited.
</p>
<p>
The ABL client is a single-threaded, fat client, even when run in batch or Appserver mode.
Although the database is multi-user, programs must be written to the client's single-threaded
limitation. We have seen this lead to application designs which emulate multi-threading using
child processes, coordinated through database or file system locking and polling, or by other
external means. These tend to be fragile and inefficient implementations.
</p>
<p>
The OpenEdge runtime leverages shared memory for efficient data access between client and database.
This is certainly an advantage on a single physical system, but it precludes splitting an application
design across systems, insofar as that advantage is eliminated by doing so.
</p>
<p>
Most modern languages support object oriented (OO) and functional programming. The ABL has
relatively weak OO facilities and no support for functional code.
</p>
<p>
By contrast, modern, open platforms such as Java can be extended in a first class manner by any
developer. They support multi-threading, first class OO programming, and functional code. They
enable efficient and multi-tier application architectures. This flexbility and power enable an
entire industry to offer a vast choice of libraries, frameworks, tools, and even languages which
add useful functionality to the core platform.
</p>
<p>
Finally, it should be noted that since conversion with FWD is fully automated and repeatable, it
can be integrated into the normal build process. Thus, FWD easily supports continued development
with the ABL. Notwithstanding the issues note above, this may be a good choice for some teams
for reasons of continuity or just preference.

<p>
A major complaint we've heard from Progress customers is that it is hard to find skilled Progress
developers, and they tend to be expensive when available. This does not appear to be a population
that is growing much, if at all, and certainly not when compared to a platform like Java. This
equates to relatively higher cost and higher risk associated with Progress development projects.
</p>
<p>
We often have heard the rationale that Progress developers justify their higher cost, because they
can be more productive with the ABL than a developer of equivalent skill using a third generation
language (3GL). However, we would contend that productivity is not an inherent advantage of the
platform when developing large scale applications, due to the complexity associated with the
enormous amount of implicit behavior in the ABL. We believe that, as a rule, it is the quality
of the developer and ones familiarity with the platform and application domain that determines
productivity.
</p>
<p>
With FWD, the direction of future development is up to you. If scarcity and cost of Progress
developers is not a pressing issue, or if re-training existing Progress developers to use Java
is a concern, you can continue developing in the ABL and just deploy your converted application
in Java.

Due to the relatively small size of the Progress market and the fact that the core platform can
only be extended by one vendor, there are limited tools available. The lack of third party tools,
libraries, and open source projects means that any feature not included in the core platform must
be implemented by each team from scratch. This results in duplicated effort and less tested, less
robust implementations for common features.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you are comfortable with the tools you are using, you can continue to develop in
the ABL and just deploy to the Java platform.

Athough the Java platform is stewarded by a single vendor, it has been open source since 2006, and
there is a community process for proposing, deliberating, and adding new features. It has attracted
the investment of numerous large and small vendors alike, and of millions of developers worldwide.
There are countless libraries, frameworks, development tools, open source projects, books,
consultants, and training materials available. The technology ecosystem for Java is thriving.

Java has all the facilities one would expect in a modern language, including object oriented
programming, functional programming, concurrency, generics, and more. Its modern architecture and
extensive facilities enable the creation of robust, scalable systems using well-tested, reusable
components.
</p>
<p>
Java has been adopted on many software and hardware platforms, giving developers a wide variety
of deployment choices.
</p>
<p>
The Java platform is extensible at multiple levels. One easily can create and integrate new
libraries in a first class manner. It is even possible to create new, domain specific languages
atop the Java virtual machine. In fact, FWD itself does this with an abstract syntax tree
processing language known as TRPL ("triple").

<p>
First and most obvious, FWD is open source and free (as in free beer) for most simple deployment
scenarios. So, many users will have no license costs at all! Even for distribution or hosting
models, the cost of a one-time, dual license will be much less expensive than the annual fees
Progress customers are accustomed to paying in perpetuity.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the out-of-pocket savings on fees compared to Progress or some other migration solution, it
is important to consider the switching costs of various migration strategies. Due to its core
design principles of 100% conversion automation and full runtime compatiblity, FWD is likely to be
the fastest and lowest cost option to migrate from the Progress ABL to Java in most cases.
</p>
<p>
The other most commonly considered options are:
</p><ul>
<li>do nothing;</li>
<li>a full manual rewrite from scratch;</li>
<li>a partial manual rewrite, assisted by partial automation.</li>
</ul>
While <b>doing nothing</b> of course doesn't really accomplish any change, it is the simplest
approach to understand and the the most familiar to implement, since it represents the status quo.
However, due to the high costs of staying on Progress vs. the lower costs of developing and
deploying on Java, this can't be said to be the least cost approach.
<p></p>
<p>
A <b>full, manual rewrite</b> can at first seem a seductive option. It gives you the chance to
correct the mistakes of the past and start fresh. However, the reality of this approach sets in
pretty quickly when you consider its actual cost and complexity. If the original application
took years or decades to develop, there is no reason to believe replacing it from scratch will
be much faster.
</p>
<p>
If any benefit of the new application is to be realized without waiting many years for the entire
effort to complete, it very likely will be necessary to integrate new modules with the original
application as they become available. This creates a more fragile, more complex, hybrid application
to support for a long period of time. It also will compromise the design of the new application,
which now has to support this hybrid, legacy mode.
</p>
<p>
The development of a replacement application will take a very long time. The original application
must be supported and maintained during this period. It would be highly unusual for user/customer
requirements to stand still for this long in most organizations, so the original application will
require ongoing development for new features as well. Parallel development of a new application
thus requires additional development resources.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, a full, manual rewrite is not the least cost option. So, what about using <b>partial
automation</b> to do the "grunt work" of a conversion effort, and manually rewriting only the parts
that the partial automation can not handle? At first, this seems like a reasonable approach, but
it suffers from many of the same drawbacks as a full rewrite.
</p>
<p>
If an automation solution is only able to address part of the conversion, it is because it skips
the hardest parts and leaves those for you to figure out! While partial solutions may churn
through your code base and claim to convert a high percentage of it, you can be sure
that those are the areas with the most regular syntax and simpler idioms. Since the result is
unfinished, it can't be built, run, and tested immediately. The 80/20 rule applies here.
You may end up with "only" 20% or so of your code to rewrite manually, but that will be the
20% that takes 80% of the time to get right. You're still facing years of rewrite effort.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, we know of no other automation solution that offers a fully compatible runtime
environment. A huge proportion of a Progress application's behavior is due to the highly complex,
implicit rules encapsulated into the black box of the ABL runtime environment. It simply is
infeasible that any conversion solution without a runtime could produce a compatible converted
application. All of that implicit behavior would have to be realized by emitting redundant, explicit,
application code. The level of code bloat simply would be impractical. 
</p>
<p>
This leads us to conclude that the result of existing partial automation solutions can not be a
compatible application. A different application with new behavior leads to modified work flows
and business processes, which results in user retraining. Of course, the application won't run
until you finish rewriting all the hardest parts, which isn't likely to be that much faster than
that full manual rewrite.
</p>
<p>
<b>FWD is different.</b> It automates 100% of the conversion, so it converts your entire
application. Yes, there is prep work to do and every application has unique challenges to figure
out. But that work is done up front, so conversion is repeatable, and the result of each
conversion cycle can be compiled, run, and tested immediately using a fully compatible runtime
environment. This means less overall project time, even, generally speaking, if gaps in the FWD
technology need to be filled or features fixed along the way. This makes FWD the lowest cost
conversion option.

<div id="LeastRisk" class="hide view-more gc-card-expand">
<p>
All the same reasons that make FWD the least cost option over doing nothing, manually rewriting
your application, or using partial automation, also make FWD the least risk approach. A shorter
project cycle and lower spend mean lower risk associated with the project.
</p>
<p>
Consider also that FWD's core design principle of strict runtime compatibility reduces the risk
of unknown application behavior. Since FWD produces a functionally identical application, there
are no new or different application flows or business processes, so the risk associated with these
types of changes is eliminated. Existing features behave as they did before. Unfortunately,
existing functional bugs will come along for the ride as well! Testing effort can be limited to
ensuring the application behaves identically before and after conversion.
</p>
<p>
Since FWD is open source, risks associated with proprietary technology are eliminated. You can
access the source without reliance on a particular vendor. Troubleshooting and fixing problems
is directly under your control.

Multiple applications have been converted and run with FWD, ranging in size from ~250K to ~6
million lines of ABL code. These include ChUI, GUI, batch, and Appserver deployments. The first
application converted with FWD was a ChUI application of ~840K lines of ABL code. It has been
deployed continuously in a mission critical, production environment at several customer sites,
24x7, without any showstopper problems since 2009.
