          <p class="analytics">
            The first step in any modernization or code improvement effort is to understand the target application. FWD
            includes a powerful source code analytics tool set to help you understand your ABL application
            better.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The FWD project has tools which preprocess and parse entire ABL applications,
            using the source code and schemata to generate Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) data structures. These ASTs
            represent the code and database structure of an application in a form that is ideal for inspection and
            analysis. FWD Analytics leverages these ASTs to present information about your application that is difficult
            or impossible to determine with conventional, text-based search techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This tool
            set evolved from the need to understand the low-level internals of applications being converted to Java with
            FWD. However, the analytics tools can be used on a stand-alone basis, even if you do not intend to use
            FWD&#39;s transformation capabilities or its Java runtime environment.

                The FWD runtime can be configured to surface a GUI (or ChUI) application through a web browser using the
                FWD thin web client (no plugins, no applets... just javascript). No user interface rewrite is required!
                The UI can be exposed in its entirety, as a virtual desktop within a browser. It looks and feels the
                same to your users as your existing application.

              <p class="text-wrapper-53">
                If modernization of your ABL application is a goal, moving from OpenEdge to Java with FWD gives you
                better options. Conversion already gets your existing user interface to the web, gets your business
                logic to Java, and gets your data to a modern database. With that behind you, you can focus on and
                prioritize the most important areas of your application to modernize. Without the need to straddle new
                and legacy platforms, multiple database implementations, and fat vs. thin deployment technologies, your
                modernization plan can be greatly simplified. With FWD&#39;s custom conversion features and the
                capabililty to extend the ABL in FWD, there are likely ways to leverage automation to further reduce the
                effort.

              FWD replaces the OpenEdge runtime and database entirely, while preserving and helping you grow the value
              of your application investment. Whether you want to convert your application to Java and not look back, or
              keep developing your application with the ABL, FWD gives you the tools to take your application to the
              next level.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Conversion is 100% automated and repeatable, so you can continue with
              your normal development in the ABL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indefinitely, or you can cut over to Java
              development at your pace. <br />FWD delivers your existing GUI to the web immediately, giving you the
              freedom to then modernize that user interface as much or as little as you want. <br />FWD is Java, giving
              you immediate access to numerous, modern technologies. <br />Wish you had a feature that OpenEdge
              doesn&#39;t provide? FWD is open source and flexible. Take a look at some planned enhancements in
              FWD&#39;s road map. Ask yourself what improvements you have always wanted and let us know (you will have
              to register to post).
            </p>
            <p class="development-model">
              FWD offers new development model options. ABL source code is converted to Java and the compiled result is
              deployed on the Java platform. That means you have the opportunity to develop your application in Java
              going forward, if you so choose. It does not mean you have to give up developing in the ABL if you
              don&#39;t want to!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You may want to eliminate your dependency on the OpenEdge
              platform, but perhaps you have concerns about retraining an existing Progress development team in Java.
              Maybe you wish to continue developing in the ABL for purposes of continuity or just preference. On the
              other hand, you may want to move forward with Java development exclusively. FWD supports either model, or
              a blend of the two. You can continue developing some or all of your application using the ABL and convert
              to Java as part of your normal build process. You choose which, if any, application components are
              developed in Java, and which in the ABL.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Regardless of the primary development
              language you choose, custom conversion features let you integrate hand-written or third-party Java code
              and maintain these dependencies consistently across application builds.
            </p>
            <p class="replace-openedge-3">
              With FWD, your dependency on all Progress technology is eliminated. Your converted application is a
              &#34;drop-in&#34; replacement for the original. FWD is different than other migration solutions. It
              provides:<br /><br />a fully automated conversion process that results in immediately compilable Java
              source code; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />a strictly compatible runtime environment that ensures your application
              behaves exactly as it did before conversion.<br /><br />The combination of these attributes minimizes the
              cost of conversion and the risk of deployment, and gives you new development choices.
            </p>
            <p class="conversion">
              The FWD conversion technology consists of an ABL-compatible preprocessor, lexer, parser, and conversion
              engine. Conversion requires some up-front work: gathering inputs, preparing conversion hints, feature gap
              analysis, and planning for external dependencies that may be different in the post-conversion environment.
              Once that preparatory work is complete, the conversion runs as a fully automated batch, as often as
              needed. The Java code it produces can be compiled immediately. The SQL data definition language it
              produces can be used to create new databases immediately. FWD includes tools to migrate your OpenEdge
              databases to PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or H2.
            </p>
            <p class="runtime-environment-2">
              FWD provides a runtime environment that makes a converted application behave exactly as the original.
              Converted code compiles against this runtime and calls into it for all the services it needs, including
              database access, user interface services, user-local resources, transaction management, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="data-migration">
              FWD includes tools to import data that has been exported from Progress databases into new, relational
              databases (e.g., PostgreSQL). The import is performed as a batch and leverages multiple CPUs.
