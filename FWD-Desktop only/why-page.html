              Your application supports critical business processes. You&#39;ve invested a lot in user training. Users
              are familiar with your application; they have muscle memory in their daily work flows. Your developers are
              familiar with the design and implementation of the application. It is very likely that you&#39;ve created
              external interfaces to your application. There is a tremendous investment in knowledge tied to your
              application.<br /><br />You want to move to a platform that gives you the freedom to grow in new
              directions and use new tools, without losing the value of that knowledge.
