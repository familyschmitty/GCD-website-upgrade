              >The core principles of the FWD technology and methodology are extreme automation and strict
              compatibility. FWD is designed to ensure you can convert, build, run, and test your application without
              having to hand-edit the converted code. This cycle can be repeated many times, and newer drops of the
              application&#39;s ABL code base even can be substituted in over the course of a migration project, without
              adding significant effort to the overall project.<br /><br />How is this possible? Support for each legacy
              feature is built into the conversion and runtime technology. If something is missing or broken, it is
              fixed in FWD once, rather than duplicating this effort across every application. To date, FWD has amassed

            While the conversion itself is automated, manual preparation of a conversion project is necessary. This can
            take minutes to weeks, depending on the size and complexity of the application. This work includes:<br /><br />Collecting
            inputs.<br />Creating conversion hints to allow FWD to make informed decisions.<br />Devising strategies for
            any external dependencies (e.g., third party software, operating system or peripheral hardware
            dependences).<br />Addressing syntax errors found by FWD in application code in early stages of conversion
            (in certain respects, the FWD code analysis is stricter than that of the ABL).<br />Feature gap analysis.<br /><br />Once
            this up front work is done, the conversion is a repeatable, automated process. The outputs are ready to run
            and require no hand-editing.<br /><br />Part of the early work in a conversion project is a gap analysis of
            the feature set used by the application compared to the feature set supported by FWD. If FWD is missing ABL
            features in use by the application, a plan must be made as to how to deal with these gaps. Either the
            features must be added to the FWD conversion and runtime code, or the features must be removed or replaced
            in the application code. While the gap analysis itself is an early project requirement, the implementation
            of any missing FWD features generally can be performed in parallel during the course of the project.<br />Once
            the up-front work is done, the automated conversion is run as a batch job. This can take seconds for a
            trivial test case of a few dozen lines, or hours for an application millions of lines in size. Early phases
            of the conversion read and analyze the schemata and source code, producing abstract syntax tree (AST)
            representations of these constructs. Thousands of conversion rules are then applied to these ASTs. This
            conversion logic analyzes, annotates, replicates, or otherwise transforms these ASTs in a pipelined process
            which eventually has gathered enough information to produce a Java replacement for the application.<br /><br />The
            FWD conversion identifies ABL statements, built-in functions, methods, and attributes used by an
            application. It recognizes higher level constructs as well, such as transactions, resource scopes, and
            common code patterns. For each of these, an equivalent Java code pattern with one or more API calls to the
            FWD runtime environment is emitted into converted code.<br /><br />Some amount of refactoring is done, to
            the degree possible without compromising the essence of the program&#39;s control flow. For example,
            temp-table and UI frame definitions are extracted from procedures and emitted into discrete Java interfaces
            and classes. Converted business logic references these resources. With input from developers, dead code can
            be identified and removed as part of the transformation of the application.

            As noted above, the middle phase of conversion generates the DDL necessary to create a new database instance
            in a modern relational database. Once data is exported from the associated Progress database, the outputs of
            the middle conversion phase can be used to import that data into the new database.<br /><br />Like
            conversion, data import runs as an automated batch job. The time this job takes to run depends entirely upon
            the amount of data to be migrated and the hardware available. The import process is multi-threaded to take
            advantage of multiple CPUs, but it is also I/O bound, so some testing will be necessary to find the ideal
            throughput.

          The key which enables FWD to produce a drop-in replacement for an existing Progress application is the
          compatible FWD runtime environment. The runtime environment consists of a custom, Java application server,
          plus a strict compatibility framework, which provides the legacy behavior an application expects. The runtime
          environment executes in a Java virtual machine (JVM), performing an equivalent service for each API call made
          by the converted application.<br />Thus, if the application operates on a GUI screen, the runtime renders that
          screen identically in a web browser and executes the same logic, but with Java and JavaScript. If the
          application opens a database transaction, populates buffers, changes records, partially undoes that unit of
          work, then commits, the FWD runtime does the same. However, it uses Java and a different database back end,
          such as PostgreSQL.<br /><br />As can be seen in Figure 2, the converted application resides within the
          server. In the FWD runtime environment, all business logic executes on the server, even for applications with
          a user interface.<br /><br />The FWD client is a thin presentation engine, which manages only interactions
          with the user and those low-level operations which must occur in the context of the client system. These
          include file system access, process launching, and other operating system level operations. This design allows
          a high degree of shared infrastructure among the various, low-level client drivers.

        <p class="front-end">
          1. Front End: <br />In this phase, we lex and parse the schemata into a schema dictionary. Then, we preprocess
          the application source code using an ABL-compatible preprocessor. Using the schema dictionary to resolve
          database references, we then lex and parse the application source code into abstract syntax trees (ASTs). ASTs
          provide a tree-based data representation of the source code&#39;s essential structure, which is more easily
          processed programmatically by downstream processes. ASTs are also created to represent the schemata for
          permanent tables, derived from the schemata exported from OpenEdge, as well as for temp-table definitions
          found in application source code.<br /><br />2. Middle: <br />The middle phase of conversion is about
          processing the schema ASTs created by the front end of conversion into outputs that can be used for the
          persistence needs of the converted application. Schema ASTs representing permanent database tables are
          converted to data definition language (DDL) scripts, to be used to create new relational databases in the
          target database environment(s). We also create data model object classes (DMOs) for both permanent tables and
          temp-tables statically defined in ABL source code. DMOs essentially are Java beans with getter and setter
          methods for each table field/column, plus annotations to represent legacy metadata. In order to use the DMOs
          with database tables at runtime, a set of object-to-relational mapping (ORM) documents are created at this
          stage as well.<br /><br />3. Code Back End: <br />The code back end uses the ASTs created by the front end
          conversion phase and applies thousands of rules to analyze, annotate, and transform them. At a certain point,
          these ASTs have been processed enough to replicate the meaning and basic structure of the original application
          code as a parallel set of ASTs which will represent the application as a set of Java classes. These new Java
          ASTs are then anti-parsed into uniformly formatted Java source code. The original code is refactored into a
          set of Java business logic classes and Java UI classes. The resulting code can be compiled immediately, with
          no post-processing or hand-editing required.<br /><br />4. Data Back End:<br />
          In the data back end phase, the DDL outputs of the middle phase of conversion are used to create new, empty
          relational databases. We use the schema ASTs created in the front end and refined in the middle phases, along
          with the new DMOs, to read application data exported from the application&#39;s Progress databases. That data
