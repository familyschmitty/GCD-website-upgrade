<p>
The FWD conversion process and runtime environment support a critical mass of legacy features
necessary to convert and run a wide range of existing Progress applications. FWD includes tools
to migrate your application data to a choice of database backends. The same converted application
code is used, regardless of the choice of database.
</p>

<p>
FWD offers exciting new capabilities not available in existing applications, including
a Direct-to-Web deployment option for GUI and ChUI applications, and an optional, enhanced
security model.
</p>

<h3 id="direct-to-web">Direct-to-Web<sup>TM</sup> Deployment</h3>
<p>
Direct-to-Web is an exciting new capability, which surfaces an
application's GUI or ChUI interface directly through a web
browser! Direct-to-Web is a built-in deployment option
immediately available upon conversion of a GUI or ChUI
application. For an application which uses standard 4GL GUI or
ChUI widgets/controls, it requires <span style="font-weight: bold;">no
rewrite of an application's user interface</span>;
in fact, it requires no additional development effort beyond the normal
conversion process. So, once an application is converted to run
as a desktop client (GUI or ChUI) or via a terminal or terminal
emulator (ChUI), it also can be surfaced through a web browser.
The same user interface which users are used to working with as a
desktop client is now available through the web!
</p>

<p>
Here's an example screen shot of a GUI screen from an ABL ADM/ADM2 demo
application, converted with FWD. It is presented in a browser using the FWD
web client, in virtual desktop mode:
</p>
<img src="images/hotel_gui_add_reservation_virtual.png" class="img-responsive"
alt="Virtual Desktop Screenshot" style="padding: 1em 0 1em 0;"/>

<p>
The web client is not a Java applet, nor does it use or have any dependency
on OpenEdge, Windows, Terminal Server, RDP, Citrix, etc. There are no plug-ins
required. It is a very thin user interface renderer and event processor,
implemented with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. It connects to a Java back-end
server where the converted application's business logic runs.
</p>

<p>
Direct-to-Web also provides the capability to integrate legacy applications with newer web
applications. If your organization is undergoing a modernization campaign or a push to the web,
but a rewrite of your existing Progress GUI application is not feasible, Direct-to-Web offers
features to ease the integration of a converted, legacy 4GL application into a "from-scratch"
web application. This can be useful in a scenario where new or expanded functionality is being
offered by a new web application, but legacy features must continue to be supported.
</p>

<p>
Here's a screen shot of the same converted ADM/ADM2 GUI application as above. However,
in this case, a converted screen from the legacy application has been embedded within
a larger web application. It is surrounded by and integrated with JavaScript controls.
The embedded legacy screen is displayed and controlled by the enclosing web application:
<img src="images/hotel_gui_integration_embedded.png" class="img-responsive"
alt="Embedded Web Application Screenshot" style="padding: 1em 0 1em 0;"/>

<p>
In the example above, all of the browser area outside the embedded legacy screen is
the enclosing/controlling web application, hand-written using JavaScript, HTML5,
CSS, and several open source JavaScript frameworks. The enclosing web application
includes the title and logo area, menu bar, footer, "Hotel Capacity" calendar control,
and "Median Revenue Earned by Room Type" chart and data table at the right side of
the browser. The remaining area containing the converted GUI screen (sans window
decorations) is an embedded iframe in which the FWD web client runs. It is connected
to the same Java back-end where the converted application runs.
</p>

<p>
In embedded mode, a converted legacy application's graphical user interface is modified to remove
window decorations and borders. In this case, it is presented using the Windows 10 theme, but it
is possible to implement different color schemes and rendering themes to integrate more seamlessly
with the user experience parameters of the surrounding web application. An API is available to
load and manage converted, legacy screens via URL within the context of the controlling web
application. It is also possible to invoke converted business logic from a web application using
a JavaScript RPC-style interface. Bi-directional communication between converted ABL code and
JavaScript is available through an enhanced implementation of the publish/subscribe feature.
These interfaces allow rich communication and data exchange between converted ABL business logic
and new JavaScript features to produce stunning, modern user interfaces, while preserving the
investment in legacy screens and programs developed with the ABL.

client features in action. See also the

<h3>Legacy Compatibility</h3>
<p>
FWD supports the following major feature areas:
<ul>
  <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI) (including ADM/ADM2), with the following deployment
  choices:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Direct-to-Web</li>
    <li>Desktop (Swing) client</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Character User Interface (ChUI), with the following deployment choices</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Direct-to-Web</li>
    <li>Desktop (Swing) client</li>
    <li>Terminal emulator</li>
    <li>Physical terminal</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A huge catalog of core language features (language statements, built-in functions, methods,
  attributes)</li>
  <li>Database access (static and dynamic)</li>
  <li>Application Server</li>
  <li>Batch processing</li>
</ul>
There are some legacy feature sets which have not been implemented
yet; however, each of these represents an incremental effort to
implement, measured at most in person months:
<ul>
  <li>ProDataSets</li>
  <li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
  <li>WebSpeed</li>
</ul>
Generally speaking, much more of the legacy environment is supported
than unsupported. As such, any currently unimplemented features
could be integrated without causing a major impact on a medium to large
project.
</p>

<h3>Deployment-Time Database Choice</h3>
<p>
Unlike with Progress data servers, your application code does not need to change in order to
support a different back end. The same converted code will work with your choice of database,
and the application's behavior will be the same, to the extent the database implementation
supports the minimum features needed by FWD.
</p>
<p>
The following databases are currently supported:
<ul>
  <li>PostgreSQL (9.4 and higher) - recommended</li>
  <li>SQL Server (2012 and higher)</li>
  <li>H2 (1.4.192 and higher)</li>
</ul>
Support for additional databases can be added with an incremental effort. Please
<a href="https://www.goldencode.com/#Contact">contact Golden Code Development</a> for details.
</p>

<h3>Enhanced Security Options</h3>
<p>
Many applications use a hand-tooled security model which commingles
security data with business data.&nbsp; FWD offers the option to
extract this security data and maintain it in an LDAP or XML-based
directory.&nbsp; This entails some custom conversion work and data
migration work, but offers the capability to centrally manage users,
groups, and permissions.
