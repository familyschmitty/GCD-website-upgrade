            Direct-to-Web is an exciting new capability, which surfaces an application&#39;s GUI or ChUI interface
            directly through a web browser! Direct-to-Web is a built-in deployment option immediately available upon
            conversion of a GUI or ChUI application. For an application which uses standard 4GL GUI or ChUI
            widgets/controls, it requires no rewrite of an application&#39;s user interface; in fact, it requires no
            additional development effort beyond the normal conversion process. So, once an application is converted to
            run as a desktop client (GUI or ChUI) or via a terminal or terminal emulator (ChUI), it also can be surfaced
            through a web browser. The same user interface which users are used to working with as a desktop client is
            now available through the web!<br /><br />Here&#39;s an example screen shot of a GUI screen from an ABL
            ADM/ADM2 demo application, converted with FWD. It is presented in a browser using the FWD web client, in
            virtual desktop mode:
          </p>
          <p class="feature-description-2">
            The web client is not a Java applet, nor does it use or have any dependency on OpenEdge, Windows, Terminal
            Server, RDP, Citrix, etc. There are no plug-ins required. It is a very thin user interface renderer and
            event processor, implemented with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. It connects to a Java back-end server where
            the converted application&#39;s business logic runs.<br /><br />Direct-to-Web also provides the capability
            to integrate legacy applications with newer web applications. If your organization is undergoing a
            modernization campaign or a push to the web, but a rewrite of your existing Progress GUI application is not
            feasible, Direct-to-Web offers features to ease the integration of a converted, legacy 4GL application into
            a &#34;from-scratch&#34; web application. This can be useful in a scenario where new or expanded
            functionality is being offered by a new web application, but legacy features must continue to be
            supported.<br /><br />Here&#39;s a screen shot of the same converted ADM/ADM2 GUI application as above.
            However, in this case, a converted screen from the legacy application has been embedded within a larger web
            application. It is surrounded by and integrated with JavaScript controls. The embedded legacy screen is
            displayed and controlled by the enclosing web application:

            The FWD conversion process and runtime environment support a critical mass of legacy features necessary to
            convert and run a wide range of existing Progress applications. FWD includes tools to migrate your
            application data to a choice of database backends. The same converted application code is used, regardless
            of the choice of database.<br />FWD offers exciting new capabilities not available in existing applications,
            including a Direct-to-Web deployment option for GUI and ChUI applications, and an optional, enhanced
            security model.

            >In the example above, all of the browser area outside the embedded legacy screen is the
            enclosing/controlling web application, hand-written using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and several open source
            JavaScript frameworks. The enclosing web application includes the title and logo area, menu bar, footer,
            &#34;Hotel Capacity&#34; calendar control, and &#34;Median Revenue Earned by Room Type&#34; chart and data
            table at the right side of the browser. The remaining area containing the converted GUI screen (sans window
            decorations) is an embedded iframe in which the FWD web client runs. It is connected to the same Java
            back-end where the converted application runs.<br /><br />In embedded mode, a converted legacy
            application&#39;s graphical user interface is modified to remove window decorations and borders. In this
            case, it is presented using the Windows 10 theme, but it is possible to implement different color schemes
            and rendering themes to integrate more seamlessly with the user experience parameters of the surrounding web
            application. An API is available to load and manage converted, legacy screens via URL within the context of
            the controlling web application. It is also possible to invoke converted business logic from a web
            application using a JavaScript RPC-style interface. Bi-directional communication between converted ABL code
            and JavaScript is available through an enhanced implementation of the publish/subscribe feature. These
            interfaces allow rich communication and data exchange between converted ABL business logic and new
            JavaScript features to produce stunning, modern user interfaces, while preserving the investment in legacy
            screens and programs developed with the ABL.<br /><br />See the FWD </span

            offers the option to extract this security data and maintain it in an LDAP or XML-based directory.  This
