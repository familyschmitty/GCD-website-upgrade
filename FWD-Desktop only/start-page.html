            FWD is a lot to get your head around. This is how we recommend you ease in...
          </p>
          <p class="introductory-videos">
            Watch Some Introductory Videos <br /><br />If you are completely new to FWD, the best way to gain a quick
            understanding is to watch a few of the demonstration videos.<br />If you have a character mode application,
            start with the FWD ChUI Demo. If you have a graphical application, start with the FWD GUI Demo. If your
            application runs primarily in batch mode or in Appserver mode, either demo will do, just to get a feel for
            some of the ground FWD covers.<br /><br />Next, watch the How FWD Conversion Works video to see the
            conversion process in action.<br /><br />Download the Code <br /><br />Download the FWD project from the FWD
            downloads wiki page and follow the instructions there to download its dependencies. Follow the instructions
            there to build FWD.<br /><br />Build a Sample Project <br /><br />Download either the ChUI demo
            application or the GUI demo application, depending on which matches your situation. If you have an
            application with no user interface (just batch or Appserver), you will be better off starting with the ChUI
            demo.<br /><br />The demo applications serve two purposes. Firstly, they provide working sample projects, so
            you can see the FWD technology converting a full (albeit small) Progress application, and running the
            converted result in Java, against a new database. Secondly, they provide a template for you to get your own
            conversion project up and running.<br /><br />At this point, just get the sample code converting and
            running, so you know you&#39;ve got a functional baseline project. Also, generate and review the standard
            reports and look through them. Follow the instructions in the wiki from which you downloaded the respective
            ChUI or GUI demo application.<br /><br />Read the Documentation <br /><br />So, now you&#39;ve gotten one of
            the samples successfully converted, built, and running in Java. You probably have a lot of questions and you
            may be anxious to try this out with your own ABL code. This is a good time to look over the FWD
            documentation. The best place to start for practical guidance on a new conversion project is the FWD
            Conversion Handbook. The Methodology chapter contains very similar information to what you are reading now,
            but with a lot more detail and references for further reading.<br /><br />You also should review carefully
            the summary of supported ABL features to get an early idea if there are any ABL features you know your
            application uses which are not yet supported by FWD.<br /><br />Use FWD Analytics to Learn What&#39;s Deep
            Within Your Code <br /><br />Before you embark on converting your application, you&#39;ll need to do some
            gap analysis to determine whether your application uses ABL features not yet supported by FWD. Don&#39;t be
            surprised if it does; FWD covers a lot of ground (most of the basics and a lot more), but the ABL is big and
            complicated. Any non-trivial application developed over a long period of time is likely either to use some
            ABL features not yet implemented, or to use some supported features in a way not currently anticipated by
            FWD.<br /><br />At this phase, you want to produce detailed reports about your application to see what&#39;s
            inside. Although not yet fully implemented across all features, there is some automated gap analysis
            directly available in the standard reports produced by the FWD Analytics tools. This will help flag
            potential problem areas quickly, using a color-coded system to indicate the level of support for certain
            language features.<br /><br />Using the framework provided by the sample project you built, follow the
            instructions in the FWD Analytics documentation.<br />Once you have gotten through the front end conversion
            and report generation processes, review in particular the reports which include automated gap analysis to
            get a sense for the coverage in FWD for the features your application uses.<br /><br />Try a Proof of
            Concept Conversion <br /><br />By this time, you&#39;re actually beyond the &#34;Getting Started&#34; phase
            and well into the implementation of a conversion project. Start small by isolating a well-scoped subset of
            your code as a proof of concept. Avoid features that are known to not yet be implemented. Generally, the
            full schema information can be used, but you&#39;ll want to cut out any code with features noted as
            unsupported in the summary of supported ABL features and which were flagged as unsupported in the
            reports&#39; gap analysis.<br />Use the framework provided by the sample project you built, and follow the
            documentation in the FWD Conversion Handbook to convert your reduced code set. As noted earlier, the
            automated gap analysis is not yet complete, so you likely will still hit unsupported areas. To address
            these, you can either further pare down your code set to omit these uses, or get help adding these features
            (see below), if they are critical to your proof of concept.<br /><br />Next Steps <br /><br />To continue
            with your FWD project from here, we recommend you consult the FWD documentation for further guidance. As
            noted earlier, the Methodology chapter of the FWD Conversion Handbook is a good next step.<br /><br />Get
